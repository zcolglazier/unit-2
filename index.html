        <p>This data was collected by the United States Census in 2010, and estimates on population were calculated using population growth rates. The census occurs every ten years, so we'll see updates to this data in 2020!</p>
        <p><b>Why do we collect census data?</b><p>
        <p>Having accurate census data is important for allocating government resources, understanding demographics and migration, and useful in all sorts of research, from looking at correlations between race and poverty to changes in urban density and gentrification. Interested in finding data like this for your own project? Check out <a>www.census.gov</a> to browse through datasets!</p>
        <p><i><small>Data was sourced from American Factfinder, run by the US Census, which will be closing soon in favor of a better platform.</small></i></p>
